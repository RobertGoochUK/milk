# Project MILK (Medicines Interoperability Logic Kit)

A collection of RESTful web services to support medicines interoperability between NHS care settings that are implemented using the FHIR standard (based on FHIR STU3). Includes conversion functions between dose-based and product-based medication orders/requests/prescriptions. Uses the data sources of the NHS Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d) and SNOMED-CT.
